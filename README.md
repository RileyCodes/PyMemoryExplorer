## About The Project

PyMemoryExplorer can scan and parse objects contained in a CPython program.

The application of this library may vary. Often this is useful to fetch information from a 3rd party software that is using a Python interpreter.

It can also be used for high-performance debugging needs, where eval is too slow to do the job.


## Features

PyMemoryExplorer come with two features:

* Object Scanner - it scans a linked list in CPython named `_gc_head` to find all Python Object that is managed by garbage collector.
* Object Parser - it supports to read the memory of a object and parse it into C++ Objects for developer to use


## Usage

Please check PyMemoryExplorerTest which demonstrate basic usage of this library.

Please read known limitation before use.
